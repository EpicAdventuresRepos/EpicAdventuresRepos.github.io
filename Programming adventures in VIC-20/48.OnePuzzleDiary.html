	<h2> One puzzle. Diary</h2>

<p> Branch distance has a limit.
</p>
<p> A text adventure is not funny if there is no puzzles to solve. I will explain you a couple of puzzles from Pursuing Tom Ram.
</p>
<p> One of the first puzzles is to read the diary.
</p>
<p> If player tries to read de diary in the very beginning of the game, you will find that you understand nothing due its fuzzy characters.
</p>
<p> If player takes the glasses and examine it, you will see everything fuzzy. Fuzzy is the clue. If you read the diary wearing your glasses in the inventory (you have not to do anything else) you will understand the diary.

<p>It seems a lot of code, but it is the same one, once and again. This is the only valid use of REad verb, so all code in in its subroutine.</p>
<p>I know that this puzzle may be so easy that players try to resolve it in a more complex way.</p>
